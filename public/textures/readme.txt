Textures needed for the Axium platform UI:

- noise.png: A subtle noise texture for adding grain to backgrounds
- marble-normal.jpg: A normal map for the 3D marble rendering

These textures need to be added to the public/textures directory to ensure the UI 
components render correctly with their visual effects.
